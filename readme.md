== Description ==

3D object (wavefront .obj) viewer for 3D objects hosted at p3d.in.
This plugin enables insertion of a 3d object hosted at http://p3d.in/ into your WordPress website posts or pages.
At http://p3d.in/ objects can be uploaded in wavefront .obj format.
P3D.in is an amazing service allowing to present your 3d models on the internet (truly in the “cloud”) and embed them into your own webpages.

The shortcode format is:
[p3d url="P3D.IN URL OF YOUR 3D OBJECT" width="WIDTH" height="HEIGHT"]

Actual example:
[p3d url="http://p3d.in/e/N7XTv+spin+load+link,shading,spin,subd,help-hidden/" width="100%" height="400px"]

*witdth* and *height* attributes are optional; the default values are **100%** and **400px** respectively.
